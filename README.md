## Usage

### Mongo Explorer

![Browser](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-explorerWithDB.png?raw=true)

For each server, the tree displays its databases with all of their collections.

* To view the content of your server, just double-click on it.
* To view the content of a collection, double-click on it and the results will be displayed in an editor tab, alongside your open files.
If you double-click on another collection, a new tab will be created for it.

If you want clear a collection or database, you can do so by right clicking on it and selecting **Drop collection/database**. Be cautious with this operation, it should not be used in a production environment.

### Mongo collection tab view

The panel shows all documents of the collections (max 300 records by default).

![Collection view](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-collectionTabView.png?raw=true)

You can copy the result and paste it in a text editor.

#### Querying

If you want to run a *find* query, click on the Magnifying glass icon or use the **CTRL+F** shortcut.

The query panel will appear at the top.

Type your filter, projection or sort query fragment in JSON format (e.g.: `{ 'name': 'foo'}`)

![Simple query view](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-queryFind.png?raw=true)

If you want to run some aggregate queries, type your pipeline as follows:
```js
{'$operator1': {...}},
{'$operator2': {...}}
```

![Aggregate query view](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-queryAggregate.png?raw=true)

Typing **CTRL+SPACE** displays a popup that allows you to select a query operator.

Additionally, you can set a row limit.

When you are done, click on the Run button (or type **CTRL+ENTER** shortcut) to see the query results.

**Note**: If you use Ultimate Edition, JSON syntax highlighting is enabled.

## Document editing

Any document can be edited by double-clicking on the **object id** (or by right-clicking). A panel will open at the bottom.

![Document edition](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-documentEdition.png?raw=true)

You can edit the value either by double-clicking or by typing F2.
You can delete a key by right-clicking on it and select **Delete this**
* Click on the **save** button to send the modification to the mongo server
* Click on the **delete** button to delete it
You can add a key or value (depending on the structure of your document) by right-clicking on it and select **Add a Key** (or **Add a Value**). A dialog will appear.

![Document edition](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-addKeyDialog.png?raw=true)

Set the key name, type and value and then validate your form.

You can also edit a document from scratch by right-clicking in the result view and select *Add* (or by typing **ALT+INSERT** shortcut)

### Mongo shell integration

If you set the mongo client path (e.g., /usr/bin/mongo), you can run the console by selecting a database under your mongo server node and click on the button **Mongo Shell** on the toolbar of the Mongo explorer.

![Browser](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-shell.png?raw=true)

### Run a file

![Document edition](https://github.com/dboissier/mongo4idea/blob/master/doc/mongo4idea-runAFile.png?raw=true)

## FAQ


### The plugin does not work. I have `ClassNotFoundDefException`

Some bugs were reported when installing the SNAPSHOT version of the plugin. Mainly some `ClassNotFoundDefException`. This could happen whenever you have a previous version of the plugin already installed in the IDE.
To fix it, the steps should be as follow:

* Locate the IDE working directory. For WebStorm, it is `.WebStorm` and for Intellij, it is `.IntelliJIdea`
* In it, remove the snapshot and the stable versions from `<working_dir>/config/plugins`
* Download again the right version for your target IDE
* Deflate the archive in the same folder
* You should have one instance of the plugin: `<working_dir>/config/plugins/mongo4idea-0.X.Y-SNAPSHOT`

Restart your IDE and it should be ok :).
